# OSCDL Mass Downloader
For when ya just aint patient no mo'.
[*Go support the actual OSC team! They're the entire reason this thing exists. Maybe donate a dolla or two? Hm?*](https://oscwii.org/)
I made this while I was bored, and, having access to GPT, I asked it to make this. Took a lot of trial and error.
I also made this because, well, the OSCDL current revision doesn't have it. Code will be deprecated and archived once it does. 
Let's get to it.

# Usage 
To start, you'll need the following things;
* Python
* A working brain
* Command Prompt
* Windows 10+
* A browser
* WinRAR
* An already set-up Wii Homebrew SD card (with all the shit yes the apps the WADs everything)
1. all the shabang install python yada yada its [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you dont have it somehow, just search for stuff like WinRAR im not linking all of that bro
2. Download both the .py and the .txt, and install the requirements in the .txt.
3. Go to [here](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/api/v3/contents) and click "Save" in the top left. This new file can be anywhere, it doesnt matter. [V3 MIGHT BE DEPRECATED IDK IF IT IS AT THE TIME OF YOU READING THIS REPLACE WITH V4 IDK OKAY] (see image)

5. Before you run the .py, go into it with any text editing software and edit this.
"JSON_FILE = "line here"  # path to your local JSON"
3b. make sure you fucking save it
6. Run the .py file in Command Prompt. This will download every single app currently in the API rep, which is like 271 apps or sm
7. Go into the apps folder, select every zip, and right-click menu "Extract each archive to seperate folder" (see image)

8. Delete all the zips when finished. Select every folder (dont worry about the insides) and drag it into your USB/SD card, where the apps folder is. Put it IN the apps folder. (see image)
